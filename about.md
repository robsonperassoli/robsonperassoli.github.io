My name is Robson Gian Perassoli.

I work with programming for more than 10 years, when I started with PHP, ever since, I had the opportunity to work with a lot of programming languages like Java, Javascript and most recently Elixir.

Over the years I could work with very different pieces of tech, like queue systems, NoSQL databases, search systems such as elasticsearch and a variety of AWS products.

In the last two years, I worked professionally as a full-stack javascript developer with nodejs and react. Aside dedicated my free time to learn more about elixir, phoenix, and GraphQL.

My last efforts with elixir resulted in Atomic - an open source time tracking tool that i've created for learning purposes, feel free to check out the code in my [Github repository](https://github.com/robsonperassoli/atomic).

To resume, I really like to learn new technologies and be challenged with problems to solve.
